# ECG prototype
My project aims to revolutionize healthcare accessibility by developing an affordable pocket-sized ECG (Electrocardiogram) machine leveraging IoT (Internet of Things) technology. By incorporating the AD8232 chip, we've engineered a compact yet powerful device capable of monitoring heart health conveniently and affordably.

Key Features:
1. Compact Design: Our ECG machine is designed to be pocket-sized, making it portable and convenient for users to monitor their heart health on the go.
2. Affordability: By utilizing cost-effective components and innovative design, we've kept the production costs low, ensuring accessibility for a wider demographic.
3. Real-time Monitoring: The device provides real-time ECG monitoring, enabling users to track their heart rhythms and detect irregularities promptly.
4. IoT Connectivity: Leveraging IoT technology, our device can transmit ECG data wirelessly to a smartphone or computer for analysis and storage.
5. User-friendly Interface: With a simple and intuitive interface, users can easily operate the device and interpret their ECG readings without specialized training.
6. Long Battery Life: The device is equipped with a long-lasting battery, ensuring continuous monitoring without frequent recharging.
 
Future Enhancements:
1. Data Analysis Algorithms: Implementing advanced algorithms for real-time analysis of ECG data to provide insights into heart health and detect potential abnormalities.
2. Cloud Integration: Integrating cloud-based storage and analysis capabilities to facilitate remote monitoring and collaboration between healthcare professionals and patients.
3. Mobile Application: Developing a dedicated mobile application for seamless integration with the ECG device, providing additional features such as personalized health insights and reminders.
