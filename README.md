# ECGprototype
My project aims to revolutionize healthcare accessibility by developing an affordable pocket-sized ECG (Electrocardiogram) machine leveraging IoT (Internet of Things) technology. By incorporating the AD8232 chip, we've engineered a compact yet powerful device capable of monitoring heart health conveniently and affordably.
